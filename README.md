Azure function demo
## Fork me
Start by forking the repo so you get your own copy.
## Setting up Azure
- Go to https://portal.azure.com/.
- Create a new function app for hosting your code.
## Connect the dots
- Head over to https://dev.azure.com/valtech-talang/
- Create a project for yourself and set up a CI/CD pipeline for pulling code from your repo and deploying to your app.
## Make it work
- Fix the bug(s?) and enjoy watching your pipeline build and deploy your code.
## In the case you finish fast and get bored
- Add (or discuss) reasonable tests to your project
